Object Orientated Javascript | Phrase Hunter Game

DETAILS

ABOUT PROGRAM | HOW TO PLAY THE GAME



Utilizing The JavaScript and Object Oriented Programming Priniciples I've Recently Studied, I've Set Out To Create A Browser-Based, Word Guessing Game: "Phrase Hunter.

This program selects a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.

Using JavaScript, I've created multiple JavaScript classes with specific properties and methods. I've created a class for managing the game, and a class to help with creating an array of Phrase objects.

This program's code chooses a random phrase, splits the phrase into letters, and put those letters onto the gameboard.

Each time the player guesses a letter, the program compares the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, the gameboard displays the chosen letters on the screen.

A player continues to select letters until they guess the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose).

If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen appears. If the player guesses incorrectly five times, a losing screen appears.

A player can guess a letter only once. After theyâ€™ve guessed a letter, the program disables that letter on the onscreen keyboard.

After building this project, I've begun to develop a good understanding of the principles of Object-Oriented Programming.
